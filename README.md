Hi,

I've made A LOT of bots in my life.

I have written messaging bots to message people on fiverr and linkedin promoting my services.

Bots's that scraped Google Maps for leads generation, or scraped g2.com for Product Data.


AND along with that I has also made some painful mistakes for example I automated linkedin using another account and got my real linkedin account blocked. Pretty Painful Isn't it?

Based on the hard lessons I learnt in Bot Development. I have built Bose Framework. 

Bose is my gift to you to help you create **undetectable**, **low boilerplate** and **easy to debug** bots 🤖 FAST ⚡️. 

## What is Bose Framework? 

Think of Bose as a Swiss Army Knife for creating Bots with Selenium using Python. 

In simplest sense Bose passes you Selenium driver which you use to automate Tasks and Scrape Data.


```python
from bose import *
        
class Task(BaseTask):
    def run(self, driver):
        driver.get('https://www.example.com')
        # ... Code
```

Here are the feautres of Bose that will save you a lot of bot development time 

- Bose adds **anti-blocking** features and **common user agents** to evade blocking from Cloudflare, PerimeterX, and other anti-bot services.

- Bose includes tools for **account generation**, **temporary email**, and **saving data as CSV/JSON** and many more.

- Bose automatically prevents the browser from closing when an exception occurs

- And goodies like guides to help you change IP, Ready Made Bots, Chrome Driver Auto Download and many more

In Spider Man Series, Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider, which gave him super natural abilities and turned him into Spider Man. 

Similar to that, after using Bose you will go from a normal Bot Developer to 10X Bot Developer


## Okay, I want to become 10X Bot Developer. How do could I learn about Bose?

Docs are the way to go! Go ahead and learn about bose [here](https://www.omkar.cloud/bose/docs/tutorial/).


## Why is it called Bose Framework?

You know, I am from colorful Country which you know as India although which I like to call it Bharat as that makes me more proud of me rich heritage. 

So, you see Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was the person who launched an attack to free India with the help of Japan and Indian Prisoners of War. 

I am inspired by his actions of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose so I decided to name my Bot Development after him. 

Similarly, to how Netaji launched a brave attack to free India, I hope that most of you will launch attacks on Websites to scrape or automate them, and use that data to help your customers/clients/people.
